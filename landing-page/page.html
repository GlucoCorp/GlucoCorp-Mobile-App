        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>GluCorp is a startup with a vision to transform healthcare through technology. 
            Our risk and assessment app aims to make healthcare more accessible for pregnant mothers, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits during this critical time and enabling them to keep track of their health.

            The app features a predictive model that screens for diabetes by closely monitoring blood glucose and blood pressure levels, allowing for early diagnosis. 
            It also includes a real-time graph for tracking glucose levels, an interactive chatbot, and a library of articles designed to educate users about gestational diabetes.
